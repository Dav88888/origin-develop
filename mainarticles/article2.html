        <h3>Shadows Behind the Camera: A Photographer's Journey with Depression</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>For a photographer battling depression, the world may appear through a different lens. </strong> 
            The constant pursuit of the perfect shot can be overshadowed by inner turmoil, creating a unique 
            struggle for self-expression and creativity. Seeking understanding and support within the photography 
            community can be a crucial step towards healing.
