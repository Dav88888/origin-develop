        <p>
            <strong>Photographers often experience a different kind of invisibility â€“ that of being the
            observer rather than the observed.</strong>  Behind the camera, they capture moments in time, but their 
            own presence can fade into the background. Despite their critical role in documenting the world, 
            photographers may find themselves feeling unseen, making it essential to acknowledge their contributions 
            and creative vision.
